# NorwegianIcecube's Advent of Code 2024

## Language & Motivation
For this AoC I have challenged myself to learn to write C++ code. I have written a bit of C before but very little C++, one of the tools I am using to learn syntax is github copilot, so if you see some "instructive" comments in the code (especially in the beginning that is the reason).

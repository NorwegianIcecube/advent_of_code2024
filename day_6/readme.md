# Part 2 solution attempt
I have tried solving part 2, but I seem to have hit a wall of some sort. For now I do not see where the problem is, I will probably come back and revisit this later.

# Part 2 alterantive solution
For p2 I have tried a brute force approach due to the manageable size of the input. However, u/Inevitable_Papaya985 on reddit had a very interesting looking solution that solves the problem in linear time, source: https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1h8fboe/2024_day_6_part_2_solving_for_all_possible/
